All communication in the DNS protocol is carried by a single format called a "message".
Each message consists of 5 sections:
- header
- question
- answer
- authority
- an additional space

- Header section is always 12 bytes long. Encoded in big-endian format.

Header section structure:
- Packet Identifier, 16 bits, random ID assigned to query packets, response packets must respond with same ID
- Query/Response Indicator, 1 bit, 1 for reply packet and 0 for question packet.
- Operation code(OPCODE), 4 bits, specifies the kind of query in a message
- Authoritative Answer(AA), 1 bit, 1 if responding server "owns" domain queried, i.e. its authoritative 
- Truncation(TC), 1 bit, 1 if message larger than 512 bytes, Always 0 in UDP responses.
- Recursion Desired(RD), 1 bit, sender sets to 1 if server should recursively resolve query, 0 otherwise.
- Recursion Available(RA), 1 bit, Server sets to 1 to indicate recursion is available.
- Reserved(Z), 3 bits, Used by DNSSEC queries.
- Response Code(RCODE), 4 bits, response code indicting the status of the response
- Question Count(QDCOUNT), 16 bits, Number of questions in the Question section
- Answer Record Count(ANCOUNT), 16 bits, Number of records in the Answer section.
- Authority Record Count(NSCOUNT), 16 bits, Number of records in the Authority section.
- Additional Record Count(ARCOUNT), 16 bits, Number of records in the Additional section.
